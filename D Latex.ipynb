    "[Latex](https://www.latex-project.org/about/) is a markup language to typeset documents. Specifically, Latex is really good at typesetting *math*.

How we are going to use Latex only scratches the surface of what Latex can be used for (i.e. writing entire papers, as an alternative to Microsoft Word). \n",
